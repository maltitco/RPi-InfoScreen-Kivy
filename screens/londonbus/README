London Bus Arrivals
-------------------

Update the "params" section of the conf.json file to include the desired bus stops.

Each entry in the "stops" section is a dictionary containing two entries:
    "description" - Your name for the bus stop
    "stopid" - the 5-digit identifier for the bus stop

You can find the identifer codes on the TfL website.

Navigate to:

        http://countdown.tfl.gov.uk

Search for the area you want, click on the bus stop and the 5 digit code will be shown beneath the map.
