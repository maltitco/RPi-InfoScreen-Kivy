Finland Arrivals
-------------------

Update the "params" section of the conf.json file to include the desired bus stops.

Each entry in the "stops" section is a dictionary containing two entries:
    "description" - Your name for the bus stop
    "stopid" - the identifier for the bus stop

You can find the identifer codes on the HSL website.

Navigate to:

http://dev.hsl.fi/graphql/console/?query={agency%28id%3A%22HSL%22%29%20{routes%20{stops%20{gtfsId%20name%20code}}}}

There is propably a way in the near future to find this ID by searching for the "code" field. But this is not the case today.
