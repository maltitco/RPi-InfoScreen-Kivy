MythTV Status
-------------

This plugin has three dependencies:
- MytvTV python bindings
- MySQLdb
- lxml

You can google instructions for the last two. However, for the first one, you just need to copy the MythTV folder from "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/" on your MythTV backend.

You also need to copy config.xml from your myth box (found at ~/.mythtv) to a ~/.mythtv folder on your raspberry pi.
