Football Scores plugin
----------------------

This screen can display updates for individual teams or for leagues (including cup competitions). There is no limit on the number of teams/leagues you wish to include.

Details of the available teams and league ids can be found in the appropriately titled files in this folder.

You should amend the "params" section of the conf.json as required.

For example:

"params": {
    "teams": ["Man City", "Chelsea"],
    "leagues": ["118998037"]
}

Would provide team updates for Manchester City and Chelsea and show all League Cup scores.

If you don't want updates for either teams or leagues, then the value should be set as an empty list e.g.

    "teams": [],
    "leagues": ["118998037"]
